Pluggable Storage
=================

Pinot enables its users to write a PinotFS abstraction layer to store data in a source of truth data layer of their
choice for offline segments. We do not yet have support for realtime consumption in deep storage.

Some examples of storage backends(other than local storage) currently supported are:

* `HadoopFS <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html>`_
* `Azure Data Lake <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/data-lake/>`_

If the above two filesystems do not meet your needs, please feel free to get in touch with us,
and we can help you out.

New Storage Type implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to add a new type of storage backend (say, Amazon s3) implement the following class:

S3FS extends `PinotFS <https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/filesystem/PinotFS.java>`_

Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These properties for the stream implementation are to be set in your controller and server configurations.

Pinot supports different kinds of storage; eg: NFS, HDFS, ADL. In order to get this working with your cluster, you will need to configure the following.

In your controller and server configs, please set the FS class you would like to support. pinot.controller.storage.factory.class.${YOUR_URI_SCHEME} to the full path of the FS class you would like to include

You also need to configure pinot.controller.local.temp.dir for the local dir on the controller machine.

For filesystem specific configs, you can pass in the following with either the pinot.controller prefix or the pinot.server prefix.

All the following configs need to be prefixed with storage.factory.

AzurePinotFS requires the following configs according to your environment:

adl.accountId, adl.authEndpoint, adl.clientId, adl.clientSecret

Sample Controller Config

.. code-block:: none

    "pinot.controller.storage.factory.class.adl": "org.apache.pinot.filesystem.AzurePinotFS"
    "pinot.controller.storage.factory.adl.accountId": "xxxx"
    "pinot.controller.storage.factory.adl.authEndpoint": "xxxx"
    "pinot.controller.storage.factory.adl.clientId": "xxxx"
    "pinot.controller.storage.factory.adl.clientId": "xxxx"
    "pinot.controller.segment.fetcher.protocols": "adl"


Sample Server Config

.. code-block:: none

    "pinot.server.storage.factory.class.adl": "org.apache.pinot.filesystem.AzurePinotFS"
    "pinot.server.storage.factory.adl.accountId": "xxxx"
    "pinot.server.storage.factory.adl.authEndpoint": "xxxx"
    "pinot.server.storage.factory.adl.clientId": "xxxx"
    "pinot.server.storage.factory.adl.clientId": "xxxx"
    "pinot.server.segment.fetcher.protocols": "adl"


You can find the parameters in your account as follows:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56349040/what-is-clientid-authtokenendpoint-clientkey-for-accessing-azure-data-lake

Please also make sure to set the following config with the value "adl"

.. code-block:: none

  "segment.fetcher.protocols" : "adl"


To see how to upload segments to different storage systems, check
:file:`../segment_fetcher.rst`.

HadoopPinotFS requires the following configs according to your environment:

hadoop.kerberos.principle, hadoop.kerberos.keytab, hadoop.conf.path

Please make sure to also set the following config with the value "hdfs"

.. code-block:: none

  "segment.fetcher.protocols" : "hdfs"
