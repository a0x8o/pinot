Updating the docs:
1. Edit or add files as needed.
2. Run "make html"
3. Open _build/html/index.html in your favorite browser and ensure contents and links work correctly.

NOTE:
You may see some differences locally as the version of sphinx-build on your local host might not be the same as the one used in readthedocs.io for building the pinot website docs.
